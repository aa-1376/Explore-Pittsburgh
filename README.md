# Explore-Pittsburgh
 Explore Pittsburgh is an application that allows users to explore Pittsburgh via three major categories, namely restaurants, events and art exhibitions. The application extracts Pittsburgh restaurant data using a Yelp API, extracts art exhibition data from a downloadable CSV file, and web-scrapes event data from Pittsburgh city websites. The highlight of the application is its user-friendly output. Using packages such as GeoPandas and Plotly, results are displayed on interactive maps and tables which visually guide users to choose an activity of their choice.
